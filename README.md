DACEBOOK | BLOCKCHAIN+REACT 


The idea of the project was to create a blockchain network based social media for the highly secured communication group (like army). So the features are like facebook+messenger features. Necessary tools and language I used to develop the system.


Ether.js (for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)

Solidity (for smart contracts)

Hardhat (for deploy environment and testing accounts

Metamask (for managing accounts and transactons)

React Js (for frontend)


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

set up metamask with your browser

at terminal at first run the command: npx hardhat node
(From here you will get some accounts. Copy the private key from here and import account from the metamask by pasting the key)


in another terminal run : npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
(From here your get the deployed address)


\DecentDrive\client> npm run dev


create a .env file to the root of the client and provide these

VITE_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= deployed address

VITE__APP_PINATA_API_KEY=collected key
VITE__APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=collected api key


```
