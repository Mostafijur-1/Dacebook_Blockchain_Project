Built a blockchain-based social media platform using Ethereum, Solidity, and React.js for secure military communications. Integrated MetaMask for transaction management and deployed smart contracts using Hardhat framework.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

set up metamask with your browser

at terminal at first run the command: npx hardhat node
(From here you will get some accounts. Copy the private key from here and import account from the metamask by pasting the key)


in another terminal run : npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
(From here your get the deployed address)


\DecentDrive\client> npm run dev


create a .env file to the root of the client and provide these

VITE_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= deployed address

VITE__APP_PINATA_API_KEY=collected key
VITE__APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=collected api key


```
